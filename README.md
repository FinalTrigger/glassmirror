# Programming Google Glass: The Mirror API

This is the most up-to-date code for the book [Programming Google Glass: The Mirror API](http://pragprog.com/book/erpgg/programming-google-glass). Each chapter is self-contained, though chapters 2-6 all build off of each other in increasing complexity to create an application called *Lunch Roulette*. Chapter 8 is its own chapter.

*This code is all free and public domain. Have fun.*
